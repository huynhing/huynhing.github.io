  <p>Wooooooooah there! You shouldn't be here! You look a little lost.</p>
  <p>Maybe I can help you find your way back?</p>
  <p>The following link will take you back to the home page!</p>
  <li> <a onclick="home();" href="javascript:;">Home</a></li>
  <p>Sorry for looking so bland, I don't get many visitors, but one day I'll look much nicer though.</p>
  <p>Anyways, what are you still doing here?</p>

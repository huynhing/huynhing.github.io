	<p>My General Manager (MyGM for short) is a JAVA command line program that scrapes basketball statistics from "basketball-reference.com" and stores them in data structures for user manipulation and retrieval.</p>
	</br>
	<p>MyGM will able to grab ANY basketball statistic and data such as PER, PPG, MPG, win shares, and player information. Users will be able to create custom teams and get the potential stats for that team.</p>
	</br>
	<p>Eventually, I want to create a GUI for the program so that it can be more usable by everyday users.</p>

	<p>I created this website out of sheer boredom during the end of Summer 2015 while taking summer classes at Cal. At the time I had little experience with HTML, CSS, and JQUERY, but in between lab and lectures I learned and this website is the result! I had the most fun writing and designing my "About Me" page and I heavily encourage you to check it out.</p>
	</br>
	<p>Right now my site heavily relies on JavaScript being enabled, because most of the fancy effects and tab changes use it. There are some redundant functions that I wrote that I will be combining with other functions (basic code cleaning).</p>
	</br>
	<p>Although it looks complete, I will be updating my website with more content in the future and improving the overall look and feel of it (maybe developing the backend). I plan on adding a music player, rather than utilizing Spotify, and eventually embedding one of my projects (MyGM) for public use. I also plan on building a JAVA command line tool that will allow me to easily update content on my page (to do this I need further organize my website).</p>

	<p id='last'>I currently have 2 domain names that point to my site: erichuynhing.com and allidoishuynh.com. I thought it'd be funny to have the second domain name (credits to John Ingrao for coming up with the name).</p.

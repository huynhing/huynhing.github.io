	<p>This was my dad's car for 12 years before he passed it onto me and made it my car. I grew up in that car and now it was mine.</p>
	</br>
	<p>It was a fast car and quite roomy, because it was a family sedan with a V6 that put out 192 horsepower and 209ft-lb of torque. Needless to say it was honestly the best car any teenager could ask, because it was safe, reliable, and had enough room for transporting friends, siblings, and groceries.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately, being the crazy teen I was, I wanted to drive stick shift and the Camry was an automatic.......</p>

	<p>After a successful first year of college, my parents decided it was time to move on from the Prelude, because...well...it was unsafe...</p>
	</br>
	<p>This is when I got my Civic Si. It was the perfect mix between my previous 2 cars. It had the sportiness of the Prelude, but also the reliability and roominess of the Camry.</p>
	</br>
	<p>I absolutely love this car (and every car I owned before) and there are many great memories to come with it (and mods!).</p>

<p>Since this is a relatively new car there isn't much done to it YET, but I am working on making it track ready and faster.</p>
</br>
<p>Work Done: Radar Detector and Dash Cam Hardwire Install, Red Out Tail Light Overlay, Chrome Delete, Bayson R Motorsports Front Lip Kit, Yellow Fog Light Overlay, Tanabe Strut Bar, and Black Tint</p>
</br>
<p>Work Todo: Rear Sway Bar (FKX), Trunk Brace (FKX), Rear Subframe Brace (FKX), Coilovers, HIDs with projectors, Window Visors (OEM), Cold Air Intake, Buddy Club Short Shifter, Hybrid Racing Bushings, Weighted Shift Knob, Catback Exhaust (Invidia Q300), RV6 Downpipe, Hondata FlashPro, and some sort of forced induction (probably CT Supercharger, but this is in the FAR future)</p>
</br>
<p id='last'>My todo list is quite long and will probably take several years (and lots of money) to complete so feel free to keep check in every once in a while to see what I've done!</p>

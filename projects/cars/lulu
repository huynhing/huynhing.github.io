	<p>Enter the Honda Prelude. I've always wanted to drive stick, but my family didn't have a car that was manual. One day, my dad bought this (ridiculously) low-priced stick shift Prelude to teach me. Immediately upon bringing it home, I loved it.</p>
	</br>
	<p>While the Camry never broke down or had issues, the Prelude was the opposite. It had a whole slew of issues that needed to be addressed. Despite these problems, it was the perfect car for my senior year and I absolutely loved driving it.</p>
	</br>
	<p id='last'>Going against common sense, I begged my dad to let me keep it and make it my daily driver. A lot of people thought it was a downgrade from the Camry, but to me it was an upgrade. Over the next year and 6 months, I worked on it, making it more driveable and upgrading various parts to make it more "sportier".</p>

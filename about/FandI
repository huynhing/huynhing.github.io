<h1>Wolf of Garden Grove</h1>
<p>Growing up, I would tag along with my mom and dad on all their business deals and ventures. My mom would show me the ropes on how to do business deals, how to spot good investments, how to run a business, and etc. My dad would take me to his shop and show me how to deal with customers.</p>
<p>As a result, I like to browse eBay every once in a while in search for cheap deals that have potential to be flipped for profit. This includes all sorts of stuff, mostly tech that can fixed or improved and sold for more. The profit then goes to my car parts fund!</p>
<p>My favorite transaction was buying a 2nd generation Apple TV for $20, jailbreaking it in less than 30 minutes, and then selling it on eBay the next day for $155. I could not stop laughing when it sold for that much.....</p>
<p id='lastline'>Also, during college breaks, I help my mom's accounting business out by issuing payroll to her clients and keeping track of her client's business expenses and such. I also did similar work (treasury positions) for various organizations and clubs in high school. I guess I could get a CPA license some day?</p>

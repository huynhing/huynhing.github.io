<h1>Finance and Investments</h1>
<p>Growing up, I would tag along with my mom and dad on all their business deals and ventures. My mom would show me the ropes on how to do business deals, how to spot good investments, how to run a business, and etc. My dad would take me to his shop and let me see how to deal with customers.</p>
<p>Both of my parents basically came to the US with nothing and managed to build their own little empire. They both passed on what they learned through all of that to me.</p>
<p>Thanks to both of my parents, I like to browse eBay every once in a while in search for cheap deals that have potential to be flipped for profit. This includes all sorts of stuff, mostly tech that can fixed or improved and sold for more.</p>
<p>My favorite transaction was buying a 2nd generation Apple TV for $20, jailbreaking it, and then selling it for $155. I could not stop laughing when it sold for that much.....</p>
<p>During college breaks, I help my mom's accounting business out by issuing payroll to her clients and keeping track of her client's business expenses and such. I guess I could get a CPA license some day?</p>

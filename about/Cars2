I absolutely love driving! There's something about it that makes me feel relaxed.<br><br>I am an avid car enthusiast and enjoy working on my car (when I have money for parts and time to install them).<br><br>One day I eventually want to own a R34 Nissan GTR or a MKIV Toyota Supra (or both!!). I am currently driving a Honda Civic Si and am working on making it track ready. To see what I have done to my current car and my past cars, go to the Cars section in my projects.

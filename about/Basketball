<h1>Ball Is Life</h1>

	<p>Being born and raised in Southern California, I am naturally a die-hard Lakers fan. Although the Lakers are going through a rough patch right now, they have a solid, promising young core in Randle, Russell, and Clarkson.

	<p>I've played basketball since I was 8, but I am no Kobe. My offensive skills are quite limited, but I try to contribute as much as possible through off ball movement. I focus most of my energy on the defensive end and I pride myself in that.

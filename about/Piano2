I have been studying and playing piano for as long as I can remember. Due to my terrible piano performance nerves, I mainly enjoy playing for myself. From 7th through 12th grade, I attended OCHSA with Piano as my main art/focus.<br><br>I love playing pieces from the Romantic to late Romantic era and anything that is composed by Chopin. My favorite piano pieces are Improvisation No. 15 in C Minor by Poulenc and Nocturne Op. 9 No. 2 by Chopin.
